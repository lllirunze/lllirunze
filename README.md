<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="20px">Hello, I am __Runze (Ryan) Li__. I'm a graduate student in New York University, majoring in Computer Science. I love Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I worked as a software development intern in Huawei, where my job was to lay flat. Currently, I'm looking for a job as SDE (seems to have found it, but in making a selection).

When I was in Tianjin University as an undergraduate student, I have done some researches in Machine Learning and Data Mining Lab, which help me learn more about machine learning and computer vision. Actually, I'm not a perfect coder. Instead, I'm a code porter with Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V(just kidding).
