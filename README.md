I'm a graduate student in New York University, majoring in Computer Science. I love Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Currently, I'm looking for a job as SDE.

When I was in Tianjin University as an undergraduate student, I have done some researches in Machine Learning and Data Mining Lab, which help me learn more about machine learning and computer vision. Actually, I'm not a perfect coder. Instead, I'm a code porter with Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V(just kidding).

I have done some projects in C and Python:

- [Dynamic Normalization in Vision Transformer](https://github.com/lllirunze/Research-on-Dynamic-Normalization-method-in-Vision-Transformer): An implement of normalization combining LN and IN.
- Graphic classification based on ResNet: Lightweight ResNet-18 using Python for classification tasks.
- [Video Recognition based on Video-Swin-Transformer](https://github.com/lllirunze/Lrz_Improved_Swin): A reimplement of designed and improved Video-Swin-Transformer using Python.
- [Two-level Cache Emulator](https://github.com/lllirunze/Computer_Organization_and_Architecture_Practice): A flexibly configurable two-level cache storage system simulator developed using C.
- [MiniMIPS32 Instruction Set Simulator](https://github.com/lllirunze/Computer_Organization_and_Architecture_Lab): Emulator for 32-bit MIPS instruction set designed using C.
- [Design and Development of TCP Protocol](https://github.com/lllirunze/TJU_TCP): TCP/IP protocol stack based on RFC793 using C.
